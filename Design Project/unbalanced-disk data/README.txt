This folder contains the data provided for system identification of the unbalanced disk setup.
The data are provided in both .mat (matlab workplace file) and .npz (numpy array file) formats.

Each file includes signals:
	ulist = input (volt)
	ylist = angle from the bottom (rad)  (and omega if full)

Simulation environment data:
	Generated by "data-gen-sim.ipynb"
	UnbalancedDisk-sim-data(.mat/.npz) (includes angle)
	
Experimental setup data:
	Generated by "data-gen-exp.ipynb"
	UnbalancedDisk-exp-all-data(.mat/.npz) (includes both angle and omega)
	UnbalancedDisk-exp-data(.mat/.npz) (only angle)
